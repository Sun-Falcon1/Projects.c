1. Program Overview
This program is designed as a Mental Health Companion Robot that helps users manage their mental well-being through various interactive features. It combines:
•	User management
•	Mood tracking
•	Journaling
•	Therapeutic conversations
•	Relaxation exercises
•	Games for distraction and cognitive engagement
•	Emergency protocols
________________________________________
2. Data Storage & Structure
The program stores data in binary files for persistence:
File	Purpose	Data Structure
users.dat	Stores registered user profiles	User struct array
mood.dat	Logs mood entries with timestamps	MoodEntry struct
journal.dat	Stores journal entries with sentiment analysis	JournalEntry struct
conversation.log	Logs all chatbot interactions	Plain text
Key Data Structures:
User Profile (User struct)
•	id (Unique identifier)
•	name, age, gender
•	emergency_contact (For crisis situations)
•	login_count, last_login (Usage tracking)
Mood Entry (MoodEntry struct)
•	userId (Links to user)
•	timestamp (When recorded)
•	mood_level (1-10 scale)
•	notes (Optional comments)
Journal Entry (JournalEntry struct)
•	userId (Links to user)
•	timestamp
•	content (Free-form text)
•	sentiment (Analyzed score from -1 to +1)

Its modular design allows for continuous improvement while maintaining accessibility for end-users. The blend of analytical and interactive features makes it particularly effective for student populations dealing with academic stress.

 
Challenges I faced while designing this program : 
My idea was about making a hardware robot , due to less hardware-oriented functionality of C , I switched on to software . Again, it needed lots of support and assistance from the programming language itself because it will need good command over artificial intelligence and all, thus I shifted to A simple program. 

I had to research and dig deeper into details of various concepts to build the project smoothly. I faced errors numerous time while debugging the raw code. But Finally, I built it. Hoping to work in a broader aspect with this project’s concept.


                                     Thank You.
